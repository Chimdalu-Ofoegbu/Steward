# Steward — a verifiable autonomous treasury agent on Casper

> An AI agent that manages a staked-CSPR treasury **natively on the Casper Network** and **proves every decision it makes on-chain**. Built for the Casper Agentic Buildathon 2026 (Innovation Track).

Steward perceives live on-chain state, decides a treasury action under a fixed strategy mandate using an LLM, **pins its full reasoning to IPFS and writes a hash of that reasoning to an on-chain "Journal" smart contract** — *before* it acts — and then executes a real native-auction staking move within risk limits enforced in code. The result is an agentic process that is **publicly auditable and independently verifiable**: anyone can fetch the agent's reasoning, hash it, and confirm it matches the attestation recorded on-chain.

**The whole loop is live on Casper testnet today.** Not a mock.

---

## The three pillars (this track's ask), all real

- **Agentic AI** — a real perceive → decide → act loop (not a chatbot). The agent reads chain state, asks `claude-opus-4-8` for a structured, schema-validated decision under a versioned mandate, and acts on its own.
- **DeFi** — real native Proof-of-Stake delegation via Casper's auction system. The agent delegated **1700 CSPR** to a validator from its own decision.
- **RWA pattern** — the verifiable-attestation pattern extends directly to compliant tokenized real-world assets on Casper; the decision schema already carries an `rwusd_target_pct` allocation field (CEP-18 mock is the documented stretch).

## The differentiator: a verifiable agent decision journal

Every on-chain action is **preceded by an on-chain attestation of *why*.** Each cycle:
1. the full reasoning + observed-state snapshot is pinned to IPFS (canonical bytes) → a CID;
2. `sha256` of **those exact bytes** is written to the Journal contract via an agent-only `record(decision_hash, ipfs_cid, action_kind, epoch)`;
3. anyone can verify: fetch the **raw** bytes for the CID, `sha256` them, and confirm it equals the on-chain hash.

**Proven end-to-end:** on-chain hash `dd6391262a5b73ad78c444ef63a15f48d704b6b07532f6f2834e3c678cffd20a` == `sha256(raw IPFS bytes)`. The frontend Verifier does exactly this check, live, in the browser.

### Honest framing (please read)
Steward proves a logged decision is **authentic, unaltered, and was made at time X by the agent's key** — *integrity + provenance*. It does **not** claim that re-running the prompt reproduces a byte-identical answer (modern LLMs use adaptive sampling). The Verifier UI and this README state this plainly: that's the honest, defensible claim, and it's the one that matters for auditability.

- **Chain layer** — `agent/sidecar/chain.mjs`, a Node **casper-js-sdk v5** sidecar (keygen / balance / transfer / delegate / confirm / deploy-wasm / journal-record / auction-info), driven from Python (`agent/src/steward/chain.py`). The **same library** powers the frontend's live reads.
- **Agent brain** — `agent/src/steward/` (`perceive`, `decide` forced-tool→validated `Decision`, `risk` guardrails, `act`, `attest`, `loop`, `state` SQLite). Mandate in `agent/strategy.md`.
- **Contract** — `contracts/` Odra 2.8 Journal (`record` + `count`/`get_record` reads + `Recorded` event; the deployer becomes the sole authorized recorder). Unit-tested.
- **Frontend** — `frontend/` Next.js 14 + Tailwind + casper-js-sdk reads; the Verifier is the centerpiece.

## How it uses Casper specifically

- **Casper 2.0 "Condor" transactions** (not legacy deploys) for transfers, native auction delegation, and the contract install session — built/signed/submitted via casper-js-sdk v5.
- **Native auction** (the system contract) for real PoS delegation — `NativeDelegateBuilder`/`NativeRedelegateBuilder`.
- A **Casper smart contract** (Odra 2.8 → WASM) for the on-chain Journal, deployed via a `SessionBuilder` install with Odra's install ABI.
- **casper-js-sdk v5** for all reads (balance, auction info, transactions) and writes.

## Run it

**Frontend (read-only, no secrets):**
```bash
cd frontend && cp .env.example .env.local && npm install && npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000  (dashboard + decision feed + Verifier, all live)
```

**Agent (one cycle):** needs `agent/.env` (copy `agent/.env.example`, add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `PINATA_JWT`) and a funded agent key.
```bash
agent/.venv/Scripts/python.exe agent/run_cycle.py
# perceive → decide → risk → attest (IPFS + Journal) → act (delegate) → confirm
```

**Contract (rebuild + redeploy):** see [`contracts/build.sh`](contracts/build.sh) (note: Casper rejects post-MVP wasm, so the build lowers it to MVP with `wasm-opt`), then `agent/sidecar/chain.mjs deploy-wasm`.

## Engineering notes (hard-won, honest)
- **pycspr can't do Casper 2.0** (Deploy-only) and the **casper-client Rust CLI won't compile on Windows** — so the chain layer is a casper-js-sdk Node sidecar, which is also shared with the frontend. One chain library, cross-platform.
- **Casper's VM rejects post-MVP wasm features** (bulk-memory, etc.); contract builds are lowered to MVP with `wasm-opt`.
- The LLM is **never the only guardrail** — `agent/src/steward/risk.py` enforces every limit (max move, ≤40%/validator, amount ≤ treasury, allowed actions) in deterministic code *after* the model responds (it clamped a proposed 4000 CSPR move to 1725).
- Secrets discipline from commit #1: `.env`, `secrets/`, `*.pem`, `*.db` gitignored; testnet only, never mainnet.
